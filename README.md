# Anh Ch√°u's Grading Tool

This project was created as I grade assignments for my students in COMP10002 at The University of Melbourne

## Context

As I went through the process, I realized that a lot of students make the same mistakes (naturally), and I
have to give the same comment over and over again. I did put down some notes in a separate page, but I have
to tab over, double click, control C and then tab back, it was tedious. If only there's a page to create
prompts ahead of time, and each prompt will come with a copy button (and probably delete as well). This will save
me precisely 1 second every time (xD), and make my life so much better it would be insane.

So I went to create one :D.

### Technology

I used React to create the website, as it was what I was most familiar with.

The UIs were taken from [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), I like how their stuffs look, that's it :D.

### Usage

The thing is pretty self-explanatory and simplistic. There's only 2 sections: your prompts and a notepad.

The list of prompts can be your comments, reviews, etc. that might need to be copied and pasted over and over and over again.
Each entry will details the content that is editable anytime, and 1 button to copy and 1 to delete the entry.
You can add in new entry anytime you want.

The notepad is for any notetaking that you might need during your work, could be important details about some particular
submissions, idk.

Have fun saving probably unnoticeable time difference :D.
